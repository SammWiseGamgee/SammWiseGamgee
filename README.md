Hi, I'm Sam Wise (Unfortunately its only my alias). 
Some of my interests are in travelling, cyber security, software developing, and video games. 
I'm currently learning a bunch of programming languages. Added Java and SQL into my set of knowledge.
I'm looking to collaborate on creating new programs. I have a few projects I will be uploading here as I build them.
You may reach me using one of my emails: frodolotr20@gmail.com
